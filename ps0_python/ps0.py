Problem Set 0: Images as Functions

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Problem 2: Produce monochrome images using their channels

    # Problem 3: crop a 100x100 center region from mono img2 and paste in mono img1

    # Problem 4:
    # a) Min and Max values of green image

    # b) normalize img1_green and then multiply with 10 and add the mean

    # c) shift img by 2 pixels to the left

    # d) subtract shifted version from original

    # Problem 5: Gaussian Noise Addition
    # a) add Gaussian noise to green channel

    # b) add Gaussian noise to the blue channel
    '''
    The same gaussian noise is more visible in the green channel than the blue,
    due to the increased sensitivity of the eye to the green color spectrum
